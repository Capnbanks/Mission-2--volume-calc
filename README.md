# Volume calculator
This project was my first attempt using Javascript, I decided to create a volume calculator as it reflected what I was doing for work at the time at a landscape supplies business,
I made it using the colour scheme of my work, essentially you just input measurements in meters and it provides you with an answer, any further work on this project would be
updating it so you can input and receive different types in units for measurements
